## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. **Gender Distribution**
- Out of **946 employees**:
  - **465 are male (49.15%)**
  - **441 are female (46.62%)**
  - **40 employees (4.23%) did not disclose their gender**
- **Gender distribution is almost balanced**, though some regions (e.g. Kaduna) and departments (like Engineering) have slightly more male employees.

### 2. **Performance Ratings**
- Most employees across all genders received **“Average”** ratings.
- Very few were rated “Very Good” or “Good”, suggesting:
  - A need to **review performance criteria**
  - Possible lack of recognition for top performers

### 3. **Salary Structure**
- **Total salary paid** across the company: **$69.72 million**
  - **Males:** $34.78M (49.88%)
  - **Females:** $31.81M (45.63%)
- Male employees earn slightly more in total across all regions.
- This could be due to **role differences**, but a **closer review is recommended**.

### 4. **Minimum Salary Compliance**
- A new regulation requires every employee to earn **at least $90,000 annually**.
- A full **salary band analysis** was done to check compliance.
- Results show that Palmoria needs to **review some salary levels** to meet the minimum standard.

## ✅ Recommendations
### 1. Ask Employees to Share Gender (If They’re Comfortable)
- Some employees didn’t say whether they’re male or female.

Kindly encourage employees to share this info, in a private and respectful way, so reports are more accurate in the future.

### 2. Make Performance Ratings Clear and Fair
  - Train managers to rate employees more fairly using clear guidelines.

Create a system that properly rewards staff who are doing great work, instead of rating most people as just “average.”

### 3. Review Salary Differences Between Men and Women
- Take a closer look at pay across similar job roles, especially in Kaduna and departments like Engineering, to make sure men and women doing the same job are paid fairly.

### 4. Make Sure Everyone Is Paid the Legal Minimum
- The law says all employees should earn at least **$90,000** a year.

Go through the salary list and fix where someone is earning less than that.

### 5. Use a Clear and Fair Bonus System
- Bonuses should be given based on how well employees perform.
  
Make the process open and easy to understand, so all employees know what to expect and feel motivated.
